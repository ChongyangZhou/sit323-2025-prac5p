Docker file instruction:

FROM node:19
This line tells Docker to use the official Node.js version 19 image as the base for the container. It includes Node.js and npm preinstalled.

WORKDIR /app
Sets the working directory inside the container to /app. All the following commands will be run from this directory.

COPY package*.json ./
Copies package.json and package-lock.json (if it exists) into the container. These files list the project’s dependencies.

RUN npm install
Installs the dependencies listed in package.json using npm.

COPY . .
Copies the rest of the project files (like index.js) into the container.

EXPOSE 8080
Documents that the app will use port 8080. This doesn’t actually publish the port — you still need to map it with -p when running the container.

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
This is the default command that runs when the container starts. It runs your app using node index.js.
